# Order-Overview-of-Tuan-Duong-Comapany

A combination of Python, SQL and Tableau

The dataset I got from Tuan Duong Company includes 3 folders for December/2022, January/2023 and February/2023. Each folder has 5 Excel files: Sales overview, Orders overview, Products Overview, Chat, Traffic, Discount_Promotion.

With python: My plan is to combine Order overview data of 3 month into one, and then do the same with the order sheets( Sales overview, Products Overview, Chat, Traffic, Discount_Promotion). The next step is to clean data to get it ready for the next phrase. By the end of this phrase, I have 5 dataframes with cleaned data.

With mySQL: I create the connection between Jupyter Notebook and Mysql server to upload dataframe. SQL was used to create tables, do some calculation regarding the profits and modify the columns.

With Tableau: I connect Mysql to Tableau in which I create an Orders Overview Dashboard.

The Order Sales, Chat, Traffic, Discount, ect data was cleaned and uploaded to Mysql server but will not be in the visualization phrase because it was not my focus this time.
